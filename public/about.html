<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. My name is Haliey Peirce. I am just starting out with web devolopment and so far I am really loving it. I am very excited to learn more as I go on.</p>

<p>I actually did some basic coding back in grade school when I went to College for Kids at Parkland Community College. I really enjoyed it then. However, I did not stick with it for very long. I wish I had but I am glad that I am getting back into it now.</p>
